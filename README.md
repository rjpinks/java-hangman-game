# Java Hangman

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- I wanted to do a small CLI Java project, so I'd be more comfortable using it in an upcoming web server.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- I've been exploring Java to use in the back-end of websites. This was to get me comfortable because the transition from Javascript has not necessairily been the most intuitive.
- What problem does it solve?
- It can pass the time while you hang out on the computer.
- What did you learn?
- One educational highlight that I definitely grasped onto during this project was the difference in operational statements. "Hello" == "Hello" should be helloVar.equals("Hello")

## Installation

Just have the JVM installed onto your machine and open the file.

## Credits

Just a shout out to Oracle making it easy enough to look up and understand class methods in their documentation.

## Future Features

Make some sort of fetch call to a web API that has a bunch of movie quotes that could populate possiblePhrases instead of having them hard wired. I'd have to use an ArrayList and a method for automatically creating the coded phrases.
